# cdSirius
**cdSirius** is an implementation of the [Sirius suite of computational mass spectrometry tools](https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/) maintained by the BÃ¶cker lab at University of Jena within [Compound Discoverer v3.3](https://www.thermofisher.com/ch/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms/lc-ms-software/multi-omics-data-analysis/compound-discoverer-software.html) from ThermoFisher Scientific.  This software is intended to allow annotation of metabolites and other small molecules with molecular formulas, 2D structures, and compound classes based on acquisition of high-resolution, accurate mass MS/MS through data-dependent LC-MS/MS analysis of complex samples.

Implementation of Sirius within Compound Discoverer uses the scripting node functionality within CD as an extensible interface between independent software programs.  Within this implementation, Sirius runs on the host PC and is called as a background service during post-processing through the Sirius API.  Mass spectral data for discrete compounds detected by Compound Discoverer are passed to Sirius for processing, and results are reported back to CD and persisted to the result file for viewing and interpretation.  Linkages among CD compounds and Sirius results are maintained within the resulting tables.
## Dependencies
Installation of cdSirius requires a number of dependencies to be installed on the host PC.  _Important_: It is recommended to install all of these dependencies as administrator so that all users will have access.  This is particularly important for the python packages.  Also, the packages should be installed in the base python environment.
* Fully licensed installation of Compound Discoverer v3.3, SP 3
* [Sirius](https://v6.docs.sirius-ms.io/install/) minimum program version 6.0.1
* [Python v.3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/).  Note that more recent versions of Python may work but have not been tested.  _Note:_ it is recommended to install Python at `C:/Program Files/Python311/python.exe`.
* [pySirius](https://github.com/sirius-ms/sirius-client-openAPI/tree/master/client-api_python) python package implementing the Sirius REST API for interfacing
* [pyEDS](https://github.com/thermofisherlsms/pyeds/tree/master) python package for programmatic access to mass spectra within Compound Discoverer result files
* [RDKit](https://pypi.org/project/rdkit-pypi/) cheminformatics python package (for implementation of future functionality in cdSirius)
* [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) data science python package
## Sirius user account
To run Sirius with CSI:FingerID and CANOPUS functionality, you will need a Sirius user account.  You can create a user account as described in the [Sirius Wiki](https://v6.docs.sirius-ms.io/account-and-license/).  The username and password will be used in the cdSirius node for authentication.  Do not re-use a sensitive password for this user account, as the password will not be encrypted and will be visible in plain text within the CD method editor. _Note_: If you are an academic user, you will qualify for a free account, but you must use your institutional email address when you register your account.  
## Installation
1. Download the source code and unpack it to a location accessible by all users.  An example might be `C:/python/cdSirius`.
2. Create a new folder at `C:/Program Files/Thermo/Compound Discoverer 3.3/Tools/Scripts/cdSirius` and copy the following files from the source code root directory to the newly created folder.  You will need administrator privileges for this:
   - `node.json`
   - `IMG_16x16.png`
   - `IMG_32x32.png`
3. Edit the node.json file you just copied to correct the paths in lines 19, 20, and 30 according to your local installation.
