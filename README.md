# cdSirius
**cdSirius** is an implementation of the [Sirius suite of computational mass spectrometry tools](https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/) maintained by the BÃ¶cker lab at University of Jena within [Compound Discoverer v3.3](https://www.thermofisher.com/ch/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms/lc-ms-software/multi-omics-data-analysis/compound-discoverer-software.html) from ThermoFisher Scientific.  This software is intended to allow annotation of metabolites and other small molecules with molecular formulas, 2D structures, and compound classes based on acquisition of high-resolution, accurate mass MS/MS through data-dependent LC-MS/MS analysis of complex samples.
Implementation of Sirius within Compound Discoverer uses the scripting node functionality within CD as an extensible interface between independent software programs.  Within this implementation, Sirius runs on the host PC and is called as a background service during post-processing through the Sirius API.  Mass spectral data for discrete compounds detected by Compound Discoverer are passed to Sirius for processing, and results are reported back to CD and persisted to the result file for interpretation.  Linkages among CD compounds and Sirius results are maintained within the resulting tables.
## Dependencies
Installation of cdSirius requires a number of dependencies to be installed on the host PC:
* Fully licensed installation of Compound Discoverer v3.3
* [Sirius program](https://v6.docs.sirius-ms.io/install/)
* [pySirius](https://github.com/sirius-ms/sirius-client-openAPI/tree/master/client-api_python) python package implementing the Sirius REST API for interfacing
* [pyEDS](https://github.com/thermofisherlsms/pyeds/tree/master) python package for programmatic access to mass spectra within Compound Discoverer result files
* [RDKit](https://pypi.org/project/rdkit-pypi/) cheminformatics python package (for implementation of future functionality in cdSirius)
* [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) data science python package
